# Awesome Image Composition  ![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)


A curated list of resources including papers, datasets, and relevant links pertaining to image composition ([object insertion](https://github.com/bcmi/Awesome-Object-Insertion)). **The goal of image composition is inserting one foreground into a background image to get a realistic composite image, by addressing the inconsistencies (appearance, geometry, and semantic inconsistency) between foreground and background.** Generally speaking, image composition could be used to combine the visual elements from different images.

## Survey
+ Li Niu, Wenyan Cong, Liu Liu, Yan Hong, Bo Zhang, Jing Liang, Liqing Zhang: "*Making Images Real Again: A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Image Composition.*" arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.14490 (2021). [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14490.pdf) [[slides]](https://www.ustcnewly.com/download/Image_composition_tutorial.pdf)


## Toolbox
We integrate 10+ image composition related functions into [libcom](https://github.com/bcmi/libcom) (the library of image composition), including image blending, standard/painterly image harmonization, shadow generation, object placement, generative composition, quality evaluation, etc. The ultimate goal of this library is solving all the problems related to image composition with simple `import libcom`.
